## Introduction

Software developers are constantly testing programs for a right implementation that satisfies their needs. The unit testers are one great tool for testing programs in various programming languages. These tools provide the programmer with fast, precise and useful code examination. Creating these testers can be a challenge for newcomers in the field of programming. Therefore, our goal is to develop a simple and useful implementation for testing. Our language will facilitate the elaboration of custom testers by any beginner or experienced programmer.  Developing testers for methods or functions often used for learning is a beneficial aspect for students or a beginner to identify if they have implemented the functions correctly. It will also help coders with more experience, when dealing with long lines of code containing many methods that need to be checked. Our language will help by detecting the methods automatically so the user just need to provide the expected output or type a keyword.
